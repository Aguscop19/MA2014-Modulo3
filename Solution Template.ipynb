    "Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are used in a wide variety of applications such as speech recognition, part-of-speech tagging, machine traslation, handwriting recognition and many more. In this section we will see how HMM can be employed to infer the position of a robot in a static enviroment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us represent the enviroment in which the robot roams around by a grid. Each square of the grid is either free or occupied, in which case we are talking about a position that the robot can not visit. Let $X_k$ be the position of the robot at time $t_k$. Given the latter, all the possible states of $X_k$ are the free spots of the grid: $S\\{s_1,s_2,\\dots,s_n\\}$, where $n$ is the number of free squares. Speaking of \"free squares,\" suppose we do not know where the robot is, so $P(X_0)=1/n$, $\\forall s_i\\in S$. Also, let $\\text{neighnors}(s)$ be the set of empty squares adjacent to $s$ and let $N(s)$ be the size of this set. Then, the transition model of a robot that moves to any adjacent and empty square with equal probability is given by\n",

In this case, the robot is equipped with four sensors that indicate if there is an obstacle or not in a particular direction. We will assume all the possible directions are North (N), East (E), West (W) and South (S). Further, there is a sensor error rate $\\epsilon$ and errors occur independently in the four sensor directions. For instance, the probability of getting all four measurements right is $(1-\\epsilon)^4$, the probability of getting them all wrong is $\\epsilon^4$. Given this, we have that there are 16 possible measurements for $E_k$ at a given time $t_k$. Also, let $d_{ik}$ be the discrepancy: the number of bits that are different from the true bits for the square $s_i$. Then, the probability that a robot in square $s_i$ would get a reading $e_k$ is equal to\n",

    "Now that we know how to define the transition and sensor models we can carry out different types of inference: we can estimate a location given a set of measurements doing filtering; we can use smoothing to infer a past location given some observations; or we can use the Viterbi algorithm and obtain the most likely path that the robot took and that produced a given set of sensor values.\n",

In particular, for both filtering and smoothing, instead of using something like the figures shown above, use heatmaps in which the color changes depending on the probability of finding the robot at a certain square given a set of measurements. For the most likely path highlight the squares associated to said path. Keep in mind that you will have to simulate the random behavior of the sensors. "

In this case, each state is a position that can be occupied by the robot, or in other words, a free cell.
